## 1. Coding

Reading for my Masters in Analytics and Management Degree, I tried hard to learn R and SQL.

## 2. Recruiting

It is time to apply for summer internship programme of 2023 for us to get our ideal job. For me, I am actively seek opportunities in investment banking and private equities.

Good luck for me :)

## 3. Reading

I keep the habit of reading because I think it is important to give myself some time to think.

Mr. Toad's Going to a Shrink is one of the books I've been reading lately.
