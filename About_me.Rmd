I grew up in Kunming, a city lies in southwest China. The climate there is very nice - warm in winter and cool in summer - for which people call it "City of Spring".

## 2. Hobbies

-   **Debate**:I joined the debate team once I entered University, and I have participated in more than 20 debate games.

-   **Board Game**: Board games like Live Action Role Play(LARP), Porker and chess always help me relax. Besides, I can also make many new friends when playing board games with others.
